Coming up with the game concept. I am thinking of a game similar to flappy birds or similar. I am going to want an object that can move through the screen and avoid objects on the screen. Maybe if I am feeling crazy, I can give the object a shooting feature that will allow it to clear more room on the screen?

Each player will take a turn (maybe have two on the screen at once?) going through the obstacles. The players will be scored based on time before they crash into a wall/object. IF I am able to figure out how to give the object a shoot feature. They will be able to shoot objects for extra points. 

From some of the research I have been doing online, Canvas might be my best tool for the job. Along with jQuery and your basic HTML/CSS this should be an addicting game to play.
