Coming up with the game concept. I am thinking of a game similar to flappy birds or similar. I am going to want an object that can move through the screen and avoid objects on the screen. Maybe if I am feeling crazy, I can give the object a shooting feature that will allow it to clear more room on the screen?

Each player will take a turn (maybe have two on the screen at once?) going through the obstacles. The players will be scored based on time before they crash into a wall/object. IF I am able to figure out how to give the object a shoot feature. They will be able to shoot objects for extra points. 

From some of the research I have been doing online, Canvas might be my best tool for the job. Along with jQuery and your basic HTML/CSS this should be an addicting game to play.

Did some research today on Canvas. Still have no idea how to use it but I am going to jump in and see how it goes.

Night update: Got the background to move. Can't get the box to move yet. Will work on it more tomorrow.

Worked on the buttons again. Can't seem to figure out how to get it to move back and forth. I did find a function online that springs the object up and that seems to work. Might have to stick with that over the arrow keys.

Added the bird as an object and a tree as an obstacle.

Was able to figure out the gravity function. It allows the game to work. The bird will automatically fall back down with this function.

Started designing the game a little bit. Adding pitures and a background to make it look a little prettier.
